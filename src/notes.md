1. start page, not sure if blobs are correct. used a youtube video from scrimba's kevin powell, they're more rounded than "blobs"

2. quiz is loading in background, when click on start, quiz page loads again. i had to set a timeout of 6 seconds as I kept getting a too many requests error.

3. cant for the life of me figure out how to style choices that are clicked but are incorrect while still
styling the correct one? now I only style the choice selected as correct or incorrect. i added properties (isClicked, isCorrect) to choices that i'm not using. not sure if this is the way to fix it? note: this took me forever to even get to work on the selection/styling part. i'm passing lots into the handle click but not sure i'm going about this the proper way??

4. other issue with being able to keep selecting choices/scoring after quiz has been submitted. i haven't looked into this yet as other isssues have been driving me crazy.

5. can only make one pass at the quiz. can't get it to resubmit again and load new questions.

6. added a react spinner thing, but I can't get that to work so it's commented out.

7. styling is incomplete, i'm more concerned with the react/js portions now but appreciate any tips.
